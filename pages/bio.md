<p>During the course of his life, Isaac Stewart has had more dreams than there are freckles on his back. When he was eight, he wanted to invent faster-than-light travel. At eleven he dreamt of being the first person on Mars. At thirteen he thought there could be nothing better than owning a sled-dog team and winning the Iditarod. Despite these passing obsessions, one dream never left him: He wanted to write and illustrate books.</p>
<p>Since then, Isaac has lived in the Philippines as a missionary, graduated with a BFA from BYU, and has worked for over a decade in the video game and entertainment industries. Though he hasn't yet made it to Mars, he loves to travel and has lived in Germany twice. With Kenneth Pike, Isaac co-authored <i>Jacob's Journal of Doom</i>, which will was released on July 31st, 2012 from Deseret Book. Isaac is also the artist responsible for the interior illustrations in the Mistborn Trilogy as well as many of the interior illustrations in the New York Times Best-Seller <i>The Way of Kings</i> by Brandon Sanderson.</p>
<p>Isaac hasn't found the sled dog team of his dreams, but he did marry the woman of his dreams. They live in Utah with their four children. Maybe someday when the kids are big enough, Isaac will hook them up to a sled and see how far they can pull it.</p>
