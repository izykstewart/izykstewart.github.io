## Map Resources

I've been making fantasy maps for a really long time; when I first played The Legend of Zelda to the time in 6th grade when the teacher read us The Hobbit and then asked us to write our own fantasy complete with a map. (Ask me about the Isle of the White Dweebs or Carcs, fuzzy winged wolves that looked suspiciously like my dog.)

Even though I've been doing this for a long time, I am still in awe of maps and the people who create them. Here are some of my favorite map places on the internet, and though I only mention these few, there are so many more. Enjoy!

My absolute favorite map site on the internet; plenty of reference, and the host there is extremely kind: [The Dave Rumsey Map Collection][1]

A few of my favorite fantasy cartographers: [Jonathan Roberts][2] [Priscilla Spencer][3] [Maxime Plasse][4]

A great place to learn about fantasy cartography: [The Cartographers Guild][5]

<!---And last, here's a silly PDF I created many years ago for a conference where I taught a little about mapmaking. I'd change it a lot today, but it's not the worst place to start.--->
